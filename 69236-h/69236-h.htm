  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>This bulletin has been prepared with the purpose of offering
some practical suggestions in regard to the organization
of the high school course in English and to the methods of
teaching English. As it is designed for the principals and
teachers of Wisconsin schools, the plan and methods conform
to the courses of study and conditions required of free high
schools in this state. The aim has not been to discuss theories
or to offer novel solutions for the problems of teaching,
but rather to present ways and means of accomplishing the
generally accepted purposes of the study of English in secondary
schools. All the methods and plans suggested have been
shown by experience to be practical, and are adapted to present
conditions in both large and small high schools.</p>

<p class='c003'>While the plan of the work has been made as flexible as
possible in order to adapt it to different schools, it has seemed
desirable to indicate definitely how all of the details of the
course should be organized and what methods should be used
to bring about the required results. The object has been to
consider the purpose of each part of the English work, and to
show as specifically as possible what must be done and to
some extent how it must be done to accomplish this purpose.
By having a definite aim for each year’s work and by seeing
clearly what is to be accomplished in each part of the subject,
the teacher of English feels responsible for the successful
completion of a specific part of the course. At the same time
the originality and ability of the teacher need not be hampered
by a definite plan but may be exercised in adapting the
work to different conditions in different schools and classes.</p>

<p class='c003'>In discussing the course in English, the general aim and
methods in teaching the important elements, composition and
reading, are taken up first, and then the particular phases
of each subject to be presented in each year, are considered.
What is presented under the general topics, reading and composition,
therefore, applies to the work of each year unless
otherwise stated, and usually is not repeated in considering
each year of the course.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>A second edition of this bulletin has made possible some
revision. No essential changes have been made, but considerable
new material has been added. Some parts have been
developed at greater length in order to explain the methods
more fully. The most important addition is the outline for the
study of composition and style, which has been included for
those teachers who desire to review the various phases of
rhetorical theory in preparation for teaching composition or
reading. The bibliography has been extended to include a
number of standard reference books on various phases of the
English work. The books have been selected on the basis of
their practical value to the teacher in the work actually required
in the high school course in English, and of the possibility
of assisting the teacher to build up for himself, at reasonable
cost, a good working library. In order to accomplish
the latter purpose the less expensive reference books have, as
far as possible, been chosen, and the price and the publisher
of each have been given.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>I<br /> <span class='large'>PURPOSE OF THE COURSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The main objects of the teaching of English as presented
in the Report of the Committee of Ten<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, are (1) “to enable
the pupil to understand the expressed thoughts of others;”
(2) to enable him “to give expression to thoughts of his own;”
(3) “to cultivate a taste for reading, to give the pupil some
acquaintance with good literature, and to furnish him the
means of extending that acquaintance.” Other subsidiary objects
may be accomplished by the study of English, the Report
points out, but these should never be permitted to encroach
upon the main purposes. While these purposes are
considered separately, and are apparently separated in arranging
the course of study, the Report continues, their mutual
dependence must constantly be kept in mind. By studying
the thoughts of others as expressed in the literature read
in or out of the class room, the pupil can be led to see how to
express his own thoughts more effectively. All reading of
good literature should tend to cultivate a taste for reading,
and all study of good literature should lead to a better appreciation
of what is best in expression. The survey of the history
of English and American literature accompanied by the
reading and study of characteristic selections of every period,
will open up to the pupil the whole field of literature in English
and will furnish him the means of judging intelligently
of what he reads. This interdependence of the main purposes
of the study of English requires the closest correlation of
every phase of the English work.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c003'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Report of Committee on Secondary School Studies, p. 86.</p>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Since the English work is divided into two principal parts,
reading and composition, it may be well to consider briefly
the purpose of each in relation to the main objects just considered.</p>

<p class='c003'>The first object of the work in reading must always be to
have the pupil understand the thought expressed on the printed
page. However thorough has been his training in the
grades, the average pupil on entering high school needs to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>taught how to read. Generally he gets but a hazy, general
idea from reading a paragraph, either because he fails to grasp
the meaning of each sentence, or because he does not combine
the sentence-thoughts in their relation to the topic. The
aim of the reading must be to enable the pupil to understand
each idea as it is presented, to combine these ideas to get
the thought of the sentence, and to follow the chain of thought
from sentence to sentence until he grasps the meaning of the
paragraph, essay, story, or poem, as a whole. As rapidly as
the maturity of the pupil permits, other elements that aid in
the better understanding of a piece of literature may be considered
in connection with the reading. The study of the structure,
the form, the author’s purpose, his style, the revelation
of the author’s personality, the relation of the piece of literature
to the age in which it was written, and a comparison
with other pieces of the same type, all give a clearer understanding
of literature. The other purpose of the reading is
to stimulate the pupils’ interest in good literature, and to lead
them to read what is worth while, on their own initiative. If
interest is aroused by the reading and study in class, of one
work of an author, it is easy to create a desire to read other
works by the same author, outside of the class room. By
suggestions and advice the teacher can do much toward directing
the pupils in their outside reading. To lead pupils to
read, understand, and appreciate the best of English literature
is certainly an aim that is worth striving to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c003'>To enable the pupil to give clear and effective expression
to his own thoughts, is the end and aim of the other important
part of the English work—composition. That composition is
the expression of his own thoughts is the first principle that
must constantly be impressed upon the pupils’ minds. The
misconception that the only ideas worth expressing in writing
themes are those derived from books, must be corrected at
once. While reproductions and paraphrases of the expressed
thoughts of others may sometimes be used as exercises, the
fact must be made clear to the pupils that these are not original
compositions, in as much as they are not the expression of
their own ideas.</p>

<p class='c003'>The relation of clear thinking to clear expression is another
factor to be considered in teaching composition. Much of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the instruction in theme writing is really concerned with
training the pupils to think logically and to arrange their
thoughts in an orderly manner. Pupils must be taught that
as they can give clear expression only to those thoughts that
are clear in their own minds, the first process in theme writing
is the clarifying and arranging of their ideas. The mental
training given by such systematic preparation for theme writing
as the making of outlines or other devices for grouping
thoughts in a logical plan, is invaluable, since, unlike that
given by other studies, it is concerned largely with the pupil’s
own thoughts rather than with those acquired from books.</p>

<p class='c003'>The third important element in composition is the style or
form of expression. The first aim of teaching composition,
whether written or oral, must be to give the pupils sufficient
command of simple, idiomatic English for the needs of everyday
life. If the average pupil can be taught to express his
ideas in clear, correct English, much will have been accomplished
by the four years’ training. Those pupils who show
natural ability in expression can be encouraged to develop
their talent for writing or speaking in connection with class
work or with the various outside activities of the school, and
may be given considerable assistance in their efforts by the
teacher of English. It is much more important, however, to
enable the majority of high school pupils to express themselves
simply, naturally, and correctly, than to attempt to
develop literary style where there is little natural ability.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>II<br /> <span class='large'>ORGANIZATION OF ENGLISH WORK</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>1. Length of Course</h3>

<p class='c012'>All high schools provide four years of instruction in English,
and most of the schools devote five periods a week to
the subject in each year. The course of study outlined in
this bulletin, therefore, is arranged on the basis of five periods
a week for four years. The successful completion of at least
two years’ work in English, one-half of which shall be devoted
to composition and rhetoric, and one-half to the study of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>English classics, is required of all students for graduation
from Wisconsin high schools, and for entrance to the University
of Wisconsin. The first two years of English are always
required of all high school pupils whether they pursue an
elective or a prescribed course of study. In some high schools
four years’ study of English is required of all pupils, and in
most of the Wisconsin high schools the curriculum provides
for three years of English in all courses. When the course of
study is partly elective, pupils are usually advised to continue
with a third and often a fourth year of English after completing
the two years of required work. Thus practically all
high school pupils pursue the course in English for at least
three years.</p>

<p class='c003'>Whether pupils who study English for three years take
up the work in the third or the fourth year of their course, is
generally determined by the arrangement of the other subjects
in the curriculum. When a choice may be made by
either third or fourth year pupils between third and fourth
year English, the principal and teacher of English can often
decide for the pupil, basing their decision in each case upon
what they know of the pupil and his plans. For some pupils
the survey of English and American literature in the third
year will be most valuable since it furnishes them the means
of extending their acquaintance with literature by independent
reading. Other pupils will doubtless derive more benefit
from the intensive study of a few classics outlined for the
fourth year.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>2. Plan of Course</h3>

<p class='c012'>The arrangement of the several phases of the English work
in the course, and the amount of time that is to be devoted
to each is as follows<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a>:</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c003'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. For a complete outline of the course see p. <a href='#Page_47'>47</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c003'>First year—5 periods a week; one-half of the time to be
given to composition, and one-half to the reading and study
of literature.</p>

<p class='c003'>Second year—5 periods a week; one-half of the time to
be given to composition, and one-half to the reading and study
of literature.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Third year—5 periods a week; from one-tenth to one-fifth
of the time to be given to the history of English literature
during the first three-quarters of the year and to the history
of American literature during the last quarter of the year;
four-fifths of the time to be devoted to the study of the works
of representative authors in each period of the history of English
and American literature; and from one-tenth to one-fifth
of the time to be given to composition.</p>

<p class='c003'>Fourth year—5 periods a week; four-fifths of the time to
be devoted to the study of typical examples of each of the following
forms of literature: the novel, the drama, the lyric,
and the essay; one-fifth of the time to be given to composition.</p>

<p class='c003'>The reading and study of literature in class in each year
is to be supplemented by library reading of literature, the
amount of which will be determined by library facilities and
other local conditions.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>3. Arrangement of Classes</h3>

<p class='c012'>If the English work is being taught by several teachers,
the distribution of classes among the teachers deserves careful
consideration. No English work should be entrusted to a
teacher who is not interested in the subject and who is not
adequately prepared to teach it. It is particularly important
that the first year classes should be in charge of the best
teachers of English that the school has in its corps. The not
infrequent practice of having the thoroughly prepared and
experienced teachers take charge of third and fourth year English,
and of assigning the first year classes to the young and
inexperienced English teacher, or even to teachers of other
subjects who have little or no interest in the work and who
are compelled to take classes in first year English because
their time is not completely occupied by their own subjects,
generally proves extremely unsatisfactory. If the pupils in
the high schools are to have the right attitude toward the
study of English, and are to begin the subject in the right
way, the best teachers must be provided for the first year
work, since much of the success of the whole high school
course in English depends upon the manner in which the introductory
work is taught.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The number of classes in English to be assigned to the
teacher and the size of these classes must also be considered.
The teaching of English requires an unusual amount of work
outside of class. First, the preparation for each day’s teaching
whether the work is in composition or reading demands
much time and energy if it is to be done as it should be. Second,
the correction of themes is a daily task that must be done
carefully and accurately and that requires the best effort of the
teacher when his mind is most keen and active. Third, personal
conferences with each pupil on his written work are now
generally conceded to be essential for successful training in
writing. All these elements must be considered in arranging
the programme of classes for teachers of English. Teachers
cannot do satisfactory work if they must prepare for five or
six classes a day, teach these classes, correct twenty-five or
thirty themes daily, and hold conferences with pupils before
and after school. The teaching of many classes exhausts the
energy of the teacher and makes accurate correction after
school or in the evening, as well as the careful preparation for
the next day’s classes, extremely difficult if not impossible.
Conferences on written work should be provided for in the
regular programme and should not interfere with the teacher’s
other duties before and after school. Four classes a day, two
periods daily for conference with pupils, and not more than a
hundred pupils in all classes, a number which requires the
correction of one hundred themes a week, is an arrangement
of work that makes possible effective teaching.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>4. Conference of Teachers</h3>

<p class='c012'>To give unity to the four years’ work in English, it is essential
that all the teachers of English in each high school
meet at frequent intervals to discuss organization, methods,
and progress of the work. Each teacher will thus familiarize
himself with the English work of the whole school, and
can do his particular part of it more intelligently and more
effectively. As the success of high school English also depends
in no small degree upon the character of the instruction
which the pupils have received in the grades, and particularly
in the seventh and eighth grades, it will be found very
profitable to have similar conferences occasionally between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the seventh and eighth grade teachers and the high school
teachers of English. A closer relation ought to exist between
the English work of the last two grades and the high
school, and there seems to be no better way to accomplish
this than to bring about cooperation between the teachers
through the medium of these conferences. The benefit to the
teachers and the great advantage that results to the English
work of the school repay many fold the time and effort devoted
to these conferences. If local conditions make these
meetings of grade and high school teachers impracticable, the
high school teacher of English should make every effort to
familiarize himself with the amount and character of the
training which the pupils have had before entering the high
school, by visiting the schools and conferring with the teachers
in the seventh and eighth grades. The knowledge thus acquired
of the earlier training of the pupils will be of great
service to the high school teacher in planning his work both
in reading and composition.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>III<br /> <span class='large'>COMPOSITION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The ability to write clearly and accurately can generally
be acquired only by practice. If this practice is to be really
effective it can not be confined to one semester or one year,
but must extend through the whole course in English. Training
in composition naturally includes a study of the principles
of the art; and since these principles are of different degrees
of difficulty, all can not be presented in one year, but must
be developed from year to year as the ability and maturity
of the pupil makes possible the comprehension and application
of them. Practice in writing and instruction in the
principles of composition, therefore, must form a part of all
instruction in English throughout the four years.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>1. Theme Writing</h3>

<p class='c012'>Since it is only by constant practice that the average
pupil can learn to write good English, it naturally follows
that the essential part of the composition work is the writing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of themes. The methods by which the pupil is given this
practice are of the greatest importance. In the first place,
as has already been indicated, it should be made clear to the
pupil what original composition is, and what it is not. The belief,
all too prevalent among pupils, that ideas for compositions
are to be obtained largely if not entirely from books,
should be promptly eradicated from their minds. They must
be constantly impressed with the fact that the expression of
their own ideas is the important factor in all original composition.</p>

<p class='c003'>The direction of the pupils to a right choice of subject for
their compositions is the first important consideration. The
possibility of writing interesting themes on the everyday incidents
in the life of the pupils and the school must be made
clear to them at the beginning of the course. After the pupils
have once been made to see the inexhaustible supply of material
which their own experience affords, there will be no
temptation to turn to books for inspiration. Throughout the
course in composition it is necessary for a teacher of English
to have a large supply of good subjects for themes. To secure
these subjects the teacher must familiarize himself with
local conditions, particularly as they affect the life and interests
of his pupils. It is an essential part of the teacher’s preparation
for teaching composition that he inform himself fully
upon the subjects of local interest upon which he encourages
the pupils to write. By his interest in the various activities
of the pupils and by his sympathy in their efforts, the teacher
not only comes to know what subjects to suggest for composition,
but gains the pupils’ confidence, and arouses in them
a desire to tell him of these activities in their written work.
With proper encouragement and interest on the part of the
teacher, pupils will soon come to take pleasure in writing of
their everyday experiences, and the themes will become a
source of greater pleasure and satisfaction to both teacher and
pupils.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is frequently desirable that the same subject be assigned
to all pupils, so that the results may be compared and presented
to the class as part of the regular instruction. At
other times it is necessary to give the class a number of subjects
from which each pupil may select the one that suits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>him best; and at still others, to suggest general topics from
which the pupil may frame his own subject. In announcing
and assigning a subject for compositions the teacher can be
of much assistance to the pupils by discussing with the class
the subject under consideration. These discussions will stimulate
interest in the subject, and will arouse a desire on the
part of the pupils to write upon it. The teacher can direct
the discussion so that the pupils will be led to consider the
best method of treating the subject and can thus prevent waste
of effort. It is necessary, however, to guard against giving
the pupil so many suggestions that little original thought
and observation will be required in writing the theme.</p>

<p class='c003'>That clear, logical thinking is prerequisite for clear expression
should also be constantly emphasized in teaching composition.
Pupils must be made to realize, as has already been
said, that unless thoughts are clear in their own minds, they
cannot expect to make these thoughts clear to others. They
should be taught, therefore, to get before their minds clearly
what they desire to express before they undertake to express
it. The first step can be taken early in the course when the
pupils are writing narratives, by urging upon them the necessity
of accuracy in observing what happens and how it happens,
since the degree of completeness of the remembrance of
the event depends upon the character of the impression. In
description, likewise, careful observation of what is to be portrayed
must be emphasized as the only means of obtaining a
complete mental picture that can be described to others. The
methods of exposition and argumentation presented in the
third and fourth years naturally involve a discussion of the
methods of reasoning and as much logic as the pupils can
comprehend. So closely related are thinking and the expression
of thought that, as has been pointed out before, much of
the work of teaching pupils to express their thoughts clearly
and accurately is really concerned with teaching them to think
clearly and logically.</p>

<p class='c003'>In all work of this kind the outline is of great value. An
outline of a paragraph analyzed in connection with the reading
will make clear the manner of arranging the subtopics
and details in an orderly form. A similar outline of the subject
of a theme, made in class by the cooperation of teacher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and pupils, will indicate the method of grouping the pupil’s
own ideas in a logical manner. After the process has been
illustrated by such class exercises, the pupils should be required
to make outlines of their themes, without assistance
from the teacher. While it is not necessary to require that a
complete outline be prepared by the pupils for every theme
that is assigned, frequent exercises in outlining the material
of the theme before it is written are desirable throughout the
course. Like all formal devices, the outline, if made mechanically,
may tend to curb the spontaneous expression of the
pupils; but rightly employed by the teacher and pupils, it will
readily become a valuable aid to clear thinking and expression.</p>

<p class='c003'>From the beginning to the end of the course in English,
the fact must be impressed upon the pupils’ minds that the
only acceptable themes are those that are the result of
thought and careful effort. Hastily and carelessly prepared
compositions and those handed in after the appointed time,
should not be accepted by the teacher. Promptness, neatness,
and earnest effort are essentials for successful theme writing
that pupils should never be permitted to neglect. While it
may seem very exacting to require that all themes be written
in black ink, on paper of uniform size, and that they be numbered
or dated and indorsed in a prescribed form, experience
has shown that these details in the organization of the work
are important for economy of time and effort on the part of
teacher and pupils.</p>

<p class='c003'>Although most of the themes will be prepared by the pupils
before coming to the class room, it is desirable to have some
of them written during the recitation period in order to give
the pupils practice in thinking and writing rapidly. At the
beginning of the course the subject may be assigned at the
preceding recitation so that the pupils may consider it carefully
and come prepared to write. After the pupils have
gained some fluency of expression, impromptu themes will
prove interesting and valuable class room exercises. Considerable
importance should be attached to these impromptu
themes and exercises as tests of the pupils’ ability to write
rapidly and accurately.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>2. Correction of Themes</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Of equal importance to the writing of themes is the prompt
and careful correction of them by the teacher, and the revision
or rewriting by the pupil. While doubtless the pupil
will gain some facility in expression by writing frequently, he
is not likely to learn how to write clear, accurate, forcible English
unless his work is carefully corrected and returned to
him promptly so that it may be revised or rewritten. In correcting
themes the purpose should be to indicate to the pupil
the errors and weaknesses of his style, in order that he may
correct these faults. The teacher, therefore, should not correct
the pupil’s errors, but should use some sign or abbreviation
to indicate the character of the fault. Much if not all
of the benefit derived by the pupil from the teacher’s correction
is lost if he does not have the opportunity to correct his
own errors in revising or rewriting the composition. Not only
is this correction of the pupil’s mistakes by the teacher bad
pedagogically, but it takes a needless amount of the teacher’s
time. It is desirable to have a simple but complete system
of signs and abbreviations indicating the exact character of
the error. In this connection attention may be called to the
value of having each school adopt some system of correction
signs and abbreviations, so that the same marks may be used
not only by all of the teachers of English, but by the teachers
of all other subjects in correcting note-books, topics, examination
papers, and all other written exercises. It is only by insisting
that high school pupils be as careful of their English
in all written work as in compositions prepared for English
classes that the best results can be accomplished.</p>

<p class='c003'>The following sign and abbreviations used in the English
department of the University of Wisconsin for the correction
of themes may serve to indicate the character and scope of
a system of correction marks:</p>

</table>

<p class='c003'>Besides indicating all the errors in every theme, the teacher
should write a concise comment on each, pointing out the
faults and merits of the theme. He should aim to make these
comments as stimulating and suggestive as possible for judicious
criticism must be constructive, encouraging the pupil in
that which is praiseworthy in his efforts, as well as aiding
him to eliminate that which is undesirable. These comments
to be most helpful should be based on the teacher’s knowledge
of the pupil’s personality and of the character of his
other themes, for each piece of written work must be regarded
as a step in the individual pupil’s progress toward
the more effective expression of his thoughts. The teacher
should also remember that firm insistence from the beginning
to the end of the course on correctness in the fundamentals
of expression such as grammar, spelling, punctuation, capitalization,
is quite as necessary as the stimulating criticism
that aims at developing more original and spontaneous thought
and expression.</p>

<p class='c003'>In order that the pupil may get the greatest benefit from
the teacher’s correction of his themes, these should be returned
for revision or rewriting as soon as possible. If the
pupil does not receive his theme until a week or more after he
has written it, the corrections and the revision and rewriting
are much less interesting and valuable than if it is returned to
him promptly. It is also easier for the teacher to correct
themes as soon as they are received rather than to allow them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>to accumulate until their number makes the correction of them
an exhausting task.</p>

<p class='c003'>In addition to the careful correction of compositions by the
teacher, other methods may be used to call attention to the
merits and faults of the pupils’ themes. The teacher may
have the pupils copy on the blackboard the themes which they
have prepared before coming to class, and the recitation period
may be devoted to the criticism of these compositions by
teacher and pupils. The pupils may occasionally be required
to correct each other’s written work, either in or out of the
class room. A recitation period can sometimes be used to advantage
for the rewriting by the pupils of themes corrected
by the teacher, who by passing from one pupil to another
during this exercise can assist each in correcting and improving
his work. While these methods often prove interesting
and valuable, they should not be regarded as an adequate substitute
for the prompt and accurate correction of themes by
the teacher.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>3. Filing of Themes</h3>

<p class='c012'>After themes have been either rewritten or revised by pupils,
they should be returned to the teacher, who must glance
over them to be sure that the pupils have made the necessary
changes. If the themes are rewritten, the original as well as
the rewritten form should be returned to the teacher for the
purpose of this comparison. It is also desirable to have some
method of filing themes after they have been returned to the
teacher. A simple method of keeping them is to use looseleaf
note-books similar to the laboratory note-books in science.
With this system the themes are first handed in on separate
sheets of uniform size, and, after they have been corrected
by the teacher and revised or rewritten by the pupil, are fastened
in the note-book. If the themes are rewritten or corrected
on the blank page of the note-book facing the original
copy, the teacher can readily compare the two forms and can
determine the character of the revision. Another plan adopted
by a number of schools is to have a large filing case with a
compartment for the themes of each pupil in the school. All
the themes should be preserved until the end of the year,
when they may be returned to the pupils.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>4. Conferences on Written Work</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In order to accomplish the best results in theme writing
and correcting, it is desirable that the teacher talk over the
written work with each pupil as frequently as his time permits.
If the English teacher’s programme of recitations is
properly arranged, he should have sufficient time to have
conferences with all his pupils once a month. Regular appointments
should be made with each pupil for holding these
conferences during those periods in which both pupil and
teacher have no recitation. At the conference the teacher
can go over with the pupil the written work of the month,
can answer questions, and give helpful suggestions for improving
the pupil’s composition and class work.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>5. Oral Composition</h3>

<p class='c012'>Although the term “composition” as used in connection
with English work usually refers only to written expression,
it is evident that the oral expression of the pupils’ thoughts
is worthy of consideration. Generally no particular provision
is made in high school work for so-called oral composition,
nor does it seem necessary to provide a distinct place for it
in the outline of the course. The importance of the form of
the recitation in every subject is emphasized by all good
teachers. The topical recitation now so frequently required
in all high school studies, if properly conducted, is the most
effective kind of oral composition that can be given. A teacher
of English, of course, should give especial attention to the
form of recitation in English classes. Pupils, after some encouragement,
will express their ideas freely in the course of
the discussions which inevitably arise in connection with the
reading and composition. Their attention should be directed
to the fact that the same principles govern the clear and
forcible expression in spoken, as in written language. The
correction of common faults in recitation, such as the “and”,
“and then” habit, will assist in eliminating these errors from
the written work as well as in improving greatly the oral expression.
During the first year the pupils may be assigned
simple topics in connection with the reading and should be
taught how to collect the material and arrange it in an outline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>form from which to present it in the class room. After
they have acquired the ability to present topics with the aid
of notes, they should be encouraged to speak without any of
these aids. The same method may be applied to the daily
recitation. In fact, it is often best to begin by having the pupils
outline the subject matter of the lesson and come to class
prepared to recite upon any topic in the outline. In this
manner the recitations in English and in practically all of the
other subjects of the high school course may be used to give
the pupils the necessary training in oral composition.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>6. Principles of Composition</h3>

<p class='c012'>In connection with the writing and correction of themes
must be studied the principles of composition and their application.
These rhetorical principles may be presented either
inductively or deductively. The pupil may either learn them
from a definite statement in the text-book, which illustrates
their application by selected examples, or he may be led to
discover the principles of effective expression from the literature
that he is studying in class as a part of the work in
reading. While much may be said for the merits of each of
these methods, the inductive plan seems to commend itself
particularly, since it makes possible a close and effective correlation
of the two elements of the English work—composition
and reading.</p>

<p class='c003'>During the first two years, when particular attention is
given to the principles of sentence and paragraph construction
in the composition work, these principles can be developed
and their application readily illustrated from the selections
that are read and studied in class. The object of the
work in reading, as has already been stated, is to teach the
pupil to get the thought clearly from the printed page. In
order to do this effectively, it is necessary to study with some
degree of care the sentence and paragraph structure of the
selection which he is reading. To get the thought of each sentence
it is necessary to understand clearly the relation of all
its parts. By noting the separate ideas as expressed in words,
phrases, and clauses, and by determining their relation in the
sentence as the expression of the whole thought, the pupil is
taught the principles of sentence unity and coherence. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>his attention is properly drawn to these principles as they are
exemplified in the literature before him, the importance and
application of them may be clearly demonstrated without
spoiling the masterpiece of literature. In fact the appreciation
of the skill of the literary artist is thereby increased,
provided the teaching is done in a proper manner.</p>

<p class='c003'>To follow the chain of thought in the paragraph, it is necessary
to see clearly the relation of each thought as expressed
in the sentence to the preceding and succeeding thoughts in
order that the development of the topic may be clear, and that
the pupil may grasp the subject in its entirety. In teaching
the pupil to get the whole thought in the paragraph, it
is necessary to consider the whole topic treated in the paragraph;
that is, to study the unity of the paragraph; and also
to consider the relation of each thought to the one central
topic; that is, the principle of paragraph coherence. Thus,
in the effort to teach the pupil how to get the thoughts of others
by reading, the essential principles of composition are absolutely
necessary. In a similar manner all the principles of
narration, description, exposition, and argumentation may be
developed inductively from the reading. By seeing the application
of the rhetorical principles in literature, the pupil
comes to realize their importance in effective writing, and is
impressed by the varied forms of their application as he is
not likely to be by selected examples isolated from their
context, in text-books.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>7. Use of Text-book</h3>

<p class='c012'>If the principles of composition may be developed from
the masterpieces that are studied in class, the question naturally
suggests itself, “Is it necessary to have a text-book at
all in studying the principles of rhetoric and composition?”
It is entirely possible to teach composition successfully without
a text-book, but owing to difficulties in the organization
of the schools, and the not infrequent change of teachers,
it is often desirable for the sake of uniformity of work to
make use of a text-book. It is also convenient, even where
these difficulties do not exist, to have a good text-book to
which the teacher may direct the pupil for a detailed statement
of the principles after they have been developed and exemplified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>in the reading; that is, to use it as a reference book.
In order that it may be used thus for reference, the text-book
selected should take up the principles of composition and
the forms of discourse in a logical manner, treating each
fully and systematically in a separate division. Text-books of
this character can be used throughout the first two years at
least, and some of them are sufficiently complete to supply
all the material needed for four years’ study of composition.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is generally conceded that text-books in rhetoric and
composition have very often been used to poor advantage by
having the pupils memorize the definitions and statements of
principles, and by devoting much of the period set aside for
composition to recitation upon the subject matter of the text
book. The principles of rhetoric and composition, of course,
have little value except as the pupil is able to apply them in
his own work or to recognize the application of them in the
work of others. The real test of his knowledge of the subject
matter of the text-book therefore is not made by having him
recite what the book contains, but by requiring him to apply
it in his own work and to perceive examples of it in that of
others.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>IV<br /> <span class='large'>READING</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>1. Methods of Teaching</h3>

<p class='c012'>The purposes already indicated for the reading are “to
enable the pupil to understand the expressed thoughts of
others,” “to cultivate an acquaintance with good literature,
and to furnish him with a means of extending that acquaintance.”
It is evident that the only way to teach the pupil to understand
the expressed thoughts of others is to have him
understand each unit of that expression. The meanings of
words, allusions, and figures of speech, as the expressions of
the idea, must be clearly understood. The intelligent use of
the dictionary and the usual books of reference should therefore
be taught at the very beginning of the course of reading.
Whenever the origin and history of a word are helpful for a
better understanding of its meaning, these may be called to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the pupil’s attention, and he should be encouraged to observe
in the dictionary the etymology of words as he looks for their
meaning. While the importance of knowing the significance
of proper names, allusions, etc., is to be impressed on the
pupil’s mind, the preparation of the reading lesson must not
be allowed to degenerate into a mere searching for the meaning
of all unknown terms in the assignment. Pupils should be
warned against the practice of making a list of all the unknown
words in the lesson and of consulting the dictionary
and other books of reference for information, without considering
the context in which the words are used.</p>

<p class='c003'>From the very beginning of the course in reading, the
teacher should make sure that each pupil gets a clear conception
of the thought expressed in each sentence. Without
undue emphasis on grammatical analysis, the pupil should
be encouraged to note the form in which the principal proposition
is expressed, and the manner in which it is modified by
the subordinate elements, for it is only by the careful consideration
of the syntactical relations that the pupil can get
accurately the thought expressed. The development of the
thought through a series of sentences constituting a paragraph
must be analyzed with equal care, so that the pupil may see
clearly the development of the thought and the relation of
each sentence to the preceding and succeeding ones and to the
paragraph topic. The amount and character of analysis in
each assignment of reading should be carefully determined
by the teacher as he prepares his work for each day, and he
must beware of having the reading lesson become merely a
formal analysis of sentence and paragraph structure, for nothing
more effectively kills the pupil’s interest in reading than
too much of this formal analytical drill on detail.</p>

<p class='c003'>Various methods may be used to assist the pupil in grasping
the thought expressed in the literature. In narration,
the retelling of the story, paragraph by paragraph, from
memory, will lead the pupils to get the details of the story
in logical groups. In description, the pupils should be required
to visualize the scene, object, or person portrayed in
words. Boys and girls can readily be interested in exercises
of this kind and will respond eagerly when asked to describe
the mental pictures which they obtain from a given piece of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>description. Sketches on the blackboard to make clear the
position of the details in the description and other devices
tend to emphasize to the pupil the importance of reading
carefully and accurately in order to get the whole thought of
the author.</p>

<p class='c003'>After the pupil has been taught to get the thought accurately,
the analysis may be extended to the forms of discourse
and the qualities of style. In short stories, novels, and
dramas the analysis of plot, the delineation of character, and
similar consideration of the principles of narration and description
will naturally receive due attention. In essays and
orations the study of corresponding principles of exposition
and argumentation gives the pupil a clearer conception and
better appreciation of the writer’s purpose and the means that
he uses to accomplish it. A study of metre and verse form is
necessary for an appreciation of the poetry read and studied
in class. The study of all these details, designed as it is to
help the pupils to understand the author’s thought, part by
part, ought always to lead to a better understanding and appreciation
of the meaning and purpose of the whole. A study
of literature that emphasizes details to such an extent that
the theme and significance of the story, the drama, or the
poem, as a whole, is neglected, fails to bring out the vital
element.</p>

<p class='c003'>The value of the ideas and ideals which find expression in
the literature must not be overlooked in planning the work
in reading. As a portrayal of life in its various activities,
literature presents to the pupil many types of character and
action, and thus gives the boys and girls a broader view of
life than their own experience affords. The analysis of character,
motives, and actions forms an interesting and valuable
part of the study of literature. Since good literature is also
an interpretation or “criticism” of life, it presents life in
its true relations and shows their significance. The author’s
interpretation of life, his judgment upon its various phases,
and the emotional coloring which he gives it, are all to be
considered in a manner best adapted to the maturity and
understanding of the pupils. The formative influence exerted
upon the character of the boys and girls by the characters
and actions portrayed in their reading, as well as by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the emotional element of literature is undoubtedly of importance,
and by some teachers is emphasized in all their
work. The ideals of conduct presented in good literature,
and the close relation between conduct and the emotions
aroused by the reading, are often factors in the ethical training
of the pupils, but the indirect and unconscious influence
of these elements is generally much more effective than many
efforts to teach lessons in ethics based on literature.</p>

<p class='c003'>Since the study of literature involves the consideration of
all these various elements, the result accomplished in reading
will depend largely upon the methods of the teacher in preparing
his work for each day’s reading. Before beginning the
reading and study of a piece of literature with a class, the
teacher should make a careful study of the whole, analyzing
and outlining it, so that the relation of each part to the expression
and development of the theme may be clearly determined.
With this outline before him the teacher can plan
each day’s reading more readily and intelligently. Every
recitation in reading should be carefully planned by the
teacher in order that each part of the work may receive
emphasis proportionate to its importance and that something
definite may be accomplished toward a better appreciation of
the whole.</p>

<p class='c003'>Owing to the fact that the study of literature is radically
different from any other subject which the high school pupils
pursue, much attention must be given to teaching them how
to read and study a piece of literature. In assigning the lesson
in reading, the teacher should indicate clearly to the pupils
what they are to do, and as far as possible, how they are
to do it. Failure of the pupils to understand clearly what is
desired of them, is the cause of many a poorly prepared recitation
in English. A well planned outline with the important
points to be considered in studying the day’s lesson, or a series
of questions concerning these points, will serve to give
direction to the pupils’ preparation from day to day, and in
the end will teach them how to read and study literature.</p>

<p class='c003'>In connection with the reading, pupils should be encouraged
to memorize the whole or parts of many of the pieces of
literature studied in class. In every year of the course the
teacher should select passages from the reading that are worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>memorizing, and should urge the pupils to learn them. To
make a task of this memorizing is not desirable, nor is it at
all necessary, for pupils will usually respond willingly to the
teacher’s suggestion as to the value of learning choice selections
of prose and poetry. The value of knowing and being
able to quote many of the finest passages in English and
American literature cannot be overestimated.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>2. Reading Aloud</h3>

<p class='c012'>Some attention should generally be given to reading aloud
intelligently. A part of each recitation may be devoted to giving
the pupils practice in distinct, accurate pronunciation,
and in reading with sufficient expression to interpret the
meaning. The teacher can do much toward showing the pupils
how to read by reading to them from time to time, and
then having them read the same selection. The frequent
practice of devoting a considerable part of the recitation
period to reading aloud in class by the pupils without individual
correction or helpful suggestion by the teacher is a
waste of time. As few high school pupils, particularly in the
first two years of their course, read sufficiently well to interpret
a piece of literature for their classmates continued reading
aloud in class by the pupils is an uninteresting exercise
that is more likely to decrease than increase the pupils’ interest,
pleasure, or appreciation. If the assignment has been read
and studied carefully by the pupils in preparation for the recitation,
the only purpose of having any portion of it read
aloud in class must be to give the pupils practice in reading
clearly, accurately, and intelligently. To be of value this
practice must be systematic and must be regarded as an exercise
in expression. Careful preparation by the pupils including
practice in reading aloud at home, and helpful criticism
by the teacher, are as essential for success in exercises in
reading aloud as in other forms of expression. Since training
in reading aloud is neither the primary nor the secondary
aim of the study of literature, the time to be devoted to these
exercises in the class room must necessarily be very limited.</p>

<p class='c003'>As the ability to read well depends in part upon the management
of the voice, some attention may be given from time
to time to the fundamental principles of vocal expression.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Occasional instruction in class in correct breathing, the control
of the voice, the position of the vocal organs in the formation
of the different sounds, and the care of the voice, supplemented
by exercises for individual practice, will aid materially
in improving the character of the vocal expression not
only in reading but also in recitation and conversation.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>3. Choice of Reading</h3>

<p class='c012'>To carry out effectively the plan for the correlation of the
reading and composition work, and to provide a well graded
course of reading adapted to the maturity and ability of the
pupils, the greatest care must be exercised in the selection of
masterpieces of literature to be read and studied in class.
Beginning with the simple prose narrative in the form of short
stories, tales, and sketches in the first year, the work should
proceed by regular gradations to more difficult types. For
the first two years of the course, during which one-half of the
time allotted to English is devoted to work in composition,
the reading should be chosen with regard to the principles of
composition and forms of discourse that are to be considered,
so that a close correlation may be made between the two elements
of the course. In the third year the study of the history
of English literature will determine the order in which
the authors are to be taken up, but the character and maturity
of the pupils must be considered in the choice of authors
and selections for reading and study in class. Again in
the fourth year the same elements must determine the choice.
It is impossible to prescribe certain books to be read in each
year, since the character of the pupils in different schools and
in different classes in the same school, makes necessary a selection
of reading adapted to local conditions.</p>

<p class='c003'>Although in the number and variety of the books the list of
college entrance requirements in English is now sufficiently
large to meet the needs of the average school, it is not necessary
to confine the selection of material for study in class to
this list. On page <a href='#Page_50'>50</a> of this bulletin is given a list of the
selections adapted for reading and study, together with suggestions
as to the years in the course in which they can be read
to the best advantage.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>In selecting editions of the masterpieces for reading in
class, the purpose and methods of the reading should not be
forgotten. If the pupil is to be taught to work out the meaning
of unfamiliar words, figures, and allusions, it is undesirable
to give him this information on every page in the form
of foot-notes explanatory of many things that with a little effort
he might find in reference books. Elaborate introductions
in which the structure and style of the masterpiece are
fully discussed are equally undesirable, since they tend to
make unnecessary any original thought or analysis on the part
of the pupils. The text of the masterpiece with a few notes
explanatory of unusual difficulties is all that is necessary in
order to carry on successfully the study of any selection.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>4. Library Reading</h3>

<p class='c012'>Throughout the course in English, the pupils ought to be
urged, if not actually required, to read considerable good literature
in addition to that read and studied in class. A list
of standard books as large and as wide in range of subjects
as the library facilities of the school make possible, should be
prepared each year, and the pupils should be encouraged to
read as many of these books as their time permits. Reading
that is done on the pupil’s own initiative is many times more
valuable than that which he does simply because of a formal
requirement. If the plan is followed of requiring that a certain
number of books be read, precaution must be taken
against making the outside reading a formal task rather than
a pleasure. The teacher can do much toward interesting the
pupils in the library reading. By reading aloud to the class
a chapter or two of a book, he may lead many of the pupils to
read the whole book. By referring in the class work to the
characters, plots, and other details of the books on the reading
list, or by quoting from them, he will often arouse the pupils’
curiosity and create a desire to read the books. By considering
the tastes and needs of the individual pupils, he can suggest
to each the books most likely to be of the greatest interest
and value. To create and develop the desire to read
good literature outside of the class room, is one of the greatest
privileges of the teacher of English.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>In general the plan of having a written review, outline, or
summary of these books, either as a part of the composition
or the reading work, is to be discouraged. Since the writing
of a book review is a difficult task for a man or woman of
broad education, it is too much to expect that the immature
high school pupil will be able to do it with any degree of intelligence
or interest. The fact constantly emphasized by
such a method, that every book which he reads must serve
as material for a book review, a summary, or an examination,
often defeats the purpose of his outside reading, since it tends
to create a dislike rather than a love for reading. The
books read by pupils may sometimes be discussed in class,
however, as a means of arousing interest in the outside reading,
and frequently pupils may be led to express their opinions
freely, and spontaneously concerning the books under discussion.
If the pupils can be turned from an oral to a written discussion
of the book more or less spontaneously, there is less
danger in having an occasional written exercise based on the
library reading.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>V<br /> <span class='large'>FIRST YEAR ENGLISH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>In outlining the work of the first year, it is assumed that
English will be pursued for five periods a week throughout
the year. Of this time one-half should be devoted to composition,
and one-half to reading. These two phases of the first
year English, as has already been indicated, should be closely
correlated, and must, of course, be taught by the same teacher.
By suggesting that one-half of the time be devoted to
each phase of the subject, it is not intended, as has already
been said, that the time should be formally divided. Instead
of setting aside two or three periods a week for composition
it is frequently more satisfactory to devote a portion of each
period to a study of the principles of composition as exemplified
in the reading or to a discussion of subjects for composition,
and thus not to interrupt the continuity of the reading.</p>

<p class='c003'>In Wisconsin high schools the present course of study for
one course, generally called the English course, presents one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>serious difficulty in connection with first year English; i. e.,
the arrangement by which grammar and composition for five
periods a week and reading and composition for five periods
a week are required of all pupils in this course. It is manifestly
undesirable for any pupils in the first year to pursue
two courses in English for ten periods a week throughout the
year. This arrangement gives the pupils in this course seven
and one-half periods of composition work during the second
semester if the course in grammar and composition is divided
so that grammar is required in the first semester and composition
in the second. It also divides the composition work between
two separate classes, part of the instruction in composition
being given in the course in grammar and composition
and part in the course in reading and composition. Since
instruction in the principles of composition without practice
is of little value especially for the immature pupils in the
first year, and since from five to seven and a half periods
is too much time to devote to composition when the amount
of practice that is possible or even desirable is necessarily
limited, the best solution of the problem seems to be to devote
the time to additional reading and not to attempt to give more
than two and a half periods, the amount assigned for other
courses, to composition work. The question of teaching grammar
is considered on page <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>1. Composition</h3>

<p class='c012'>The object of the first year in composition should be to
encourage pupils to express freely their own ideas and impressions.
Fluency of expression is to be encouraged by every
possible means. The most effective method of developing
this free and fluent expression is to have the pupils write
on subjects in which they are most interested. It is sometimes
said that the difficulty in writing themes in the first
year lies in the fact that the pupils have nothing to write
about from their own experience, and that therefore subjects
must be drawn largely from the reading; that is, pupils must
reproduce others’ thoughts rather than express their own.
It seems doubtful whether this paucity of ideas really exists,
for it is indeed a stupid girl or boy in the first year at high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>school who is not interested in many things in active everyday
life, and who does not talk constantly of these things to
schoolmates and friends. It is doubtless true that the pupil
often does not consider his simple experiences of sufficient
importance to be the subjects of his compositions and must
therefore be led by the teacher to see the possibilities which
they contain. It is the duty of the teacher of composition,
as has been said, to familiarize himself with the surroundings
of his pupils, and to interest himself in their various activities
in and out of school. It is only by such sympathy and
interest that he can get his pupils to express themselves
freely in their themes. Experience has shown that the daily
life of the individual pupil, and the varied activities of the
school can be made to furnish practically all of the theme
subjects not only for first year composition, but also for that
of the other three years.</p>

<p class='c003'>While fluency and spontaneity of expression should be encouraged
in every way possible, the teacher must also insist
on accuracy in details of expression. The common errors in
grammar, spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and other matters
of form should be corrected constantly, and by the end
of the first year all such mistakes should be fairly well eliminated
from the average pupil’s work. In connection with
the correction of errors in the themes, the rules of spelling,
capitalization, punctuation, and grammar may be reviewed to
advantage from time to time.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>2. English Grammar</h3>

<p class='c012'>It is not desirable to take up formally the study of English,
grammar as a regular part of first year English. Whenever
the plan of devoting a semester or a term to English grammar
has been tried, it has been conceded that the course has not
been very successful. The cause of this is not far to seek.
Since the pupils have been drilled in grammar in the seventh
and eighth grades, a repetition of the subject at the beginning
of the high school course invariably proves distasteful, and it
is extremely difficult if not practically impossible to arouse
any interest in the subject. High school pupils in the first
year are too immature to take up the subject from a point of
view materially different from that from which it was studied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>in the grades. The work, consequently, is done in a perfunctory
manner, and seems to have little practical result in the
pupils’ written or spoken English. It is the general experience,
nevertheless, that a number of pupils entering the high
school are deficient in their knowledge of the most elementary
principles of English grammar, and that they are therefore
somewhat handicapped in taking up the study of composition.
If the present system of promotion permits some pupils to enter
the high school without a sufficient knowledge of the elements
of English grammar to make possible an intelligent
study of high school English, it seems very doubtful whether
the high school course in English should be planned to provide
for pupils whose preparation is deficient. If provision must be
made for the deficient ones, a special class in grammar should
be organized for their benefit, and well-prepared pupils should
not be compelled to repeat this grade work. This special review
of grammar for poorly prepared pupils should not form a part
of the regular English work of the first year, and it may be
questioned whether it should be credited for graduation from
high school. For pupils of required preparation the only study
of grammar necessary in the first year may be taken up in
connection with the correction of errors made by the pupils in
composition. Syntax must be studied in connection with the
construction of sentences in composition work. A consideration
of the grammatical construction of sentences required for
effective work in reading and composition, with such review
of grammar as is made necessary by the actual errors of the
pupils, will generally be sufficient training in grammar for
the first year.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>3. Rhetorical Principles</h3>

<p class='c012'>The study of rhetorical principles in the first year should
be confined to the consideration of the simpler principles of
sentence and paragraph construction. In connection with the
study of grammatical construction of sentences, the violation
of the principles of sentence unity and sentence coherence
in the pupils’ written work will offer opportunity for enlarging
upon the application of these principles. If, in the first
year, pupils can be taught to express simple ideas in sentences
the parts of which are logically connected, much will have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>been accomplished. In paragraph construction unity and coherence
must also be emphasized; that is, the pupils should
be taught that the paragraph consists of a series of closely
related sentences developing a single topic. The unity of
the paragraph as emphasized by the part of the definition referring
to the single topic, and the principle of coherence, as
brought out by the idea of a series of related sentences, constitute
the important points regarding paragraph construction
to be developed in the first year.</p>

<p class='c003'>The simplest principles of narration, such as the choice,
order, and connection of incidents, may be emphasized and developed
in the pupils’ composition work. Examples of the application
of these principles will be noted constantly in the
short stories read in class. During the second semester the
elementary principles of description can be developed from
the reading, and pupils can be led to add a descriptive element
to their narrative themes, or even to write short descriptive
themes. After studying the descriptive methods
used in the portrayal of a character or scene in the story
read in class, the pupils may very naturally be encouraged to
write descriptions of persons or places with which they are
familiar. The knowledge and application of these principles
of composition, thoroughly mastered, is all the rhetoric that
is necessary for the first year.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>4. Theme Writing</h3>

<p class='c012'>In the first year one or two short themes a week will give
sufficient practice in composition. A short theme should consist
of one well-rounded paragraph of about 150 words. The
one-paragraph theme of this length has several advantages.
First, the pupil is taught from the beginning of his high
school composition work to regard the paragraph as a unit
of some length, which may be complete in itself. Second, the
pupil usually has enough ideas for a short theme, and can
present them simply and directly without writing to fill space,
as he sometimes must do when longer themes are required.
Third, a teacher can correct these short single page themes in
less time, and yet see clearly the pupil’s faults, for he is
likely to make the characteristic errors as evident in one page
as in three or four. If the teacher has time to correct carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>two short themes a week, one of these may be prepared
outside the class room, and the other may be written during
part of one of the recitation periods. This plan gives the
pupil practice in carefully prepared written work for the
writing of which he has plenty of time, and also in writing
rapidly in class when he has time to prepare but a single
draft of his theme.</p>

<p class='c003'>As in all composition work, these themes must be promptly
and carefully corrected by the teacher; and the errors, as
has already been pointed out, should be indicated by signs and
abbreviations so that the pupil may have the benefit of correcting
his mistakes. This correction by the pupil may be
done either by rewriting the theme or by revising it and making
corrections neatly between the lines, or in some other convenient
place. In either case, the work should be returned to
the teacher so that he may glance over the original and rewritten
forms, or the original as revised, and may see whether
the errors have been corrected and the changes properly made.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the first year the conferences of teacher and pupil on
composition work are of great importance. By talking over
the work, the teacher can do much towards encouraging a pupil
who becomes disheartened because of the difficulties in expressing
his ideas in writing. In these conferences, also, the
teacher can learn much concerning the pupil’s interests and
character, and by sympathy and insight can be as helpful to
the excellent pupil as to the mediocre or poor one.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>5. Reading</h3>

<p class='c012'>The selection of suitable masterpieces for reading and
study in the first year must be made with particular care,
since the pupils’ attitude toward the reading and study of
literature is often influenced for some time by their first impressions.
As the purpose of the reading is not only to have
the pupils understand what they read by teaching them to
read carefully and accurately, but also to interest them in
reading good literature, it is desirable to begin on material
that does not present too many difficulties. The length of
the selection is also an important element. The piece of literature
must not be so long that interest in it flags or that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the pupil can not grasp it in its entirety and study it as a
unit. Short stories, tales, and narrative and descriptive
sketches combine more of the desired elements than other
forms of literature. Prose narratives of this type also make
possible the close and effective correlation of the reading and
composition, the importance of which has already been emphasized.
Among the short stories and sketches that have
been used successfully in the first year and that may be taken
as typical are Hawthorne’s “Twice Told Tales”, Irving’s “Rip
Van Winkle” and “Legend of Sleepy Hollow”, Holmes’ “My
Hunt After the Captain”, Warner’s “A-Hunting of the Deer”,
Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol”. Mythology and folk tales have
also been tried with considerable success in the first semester
of the first year; the available selections include Hawthorne’s
“Wonder Book”, Church’s “The Story of the Iliad” and “The
Story of the Odyssey”, Peabody’s “Old Greek Folk Stories”,
Bryant’s translations of the “Iliad” and the “Odyssey” and
Palmer’s translation of the “Odyssey”.</p>

<p class='c003'>The advantages of using prose for reading and study in
the first year in preference to poetry or the poetical drama,
are important ones. In the first place since it is desirable to
teach pupils to get the whole thought contained in what they
read, it is undoubtedly best to begin with those forms in which
ideas are expressed in the usual order, which, of course, is that
of prose rather than that of poetry or the poetical drama. The
training in following and grasping in their entirety the expressed
thoughts of others as they appear in the simplest logical
order of prose should be one of the first aims of the first
year reading. In the second place poetic inversions and figurative
expressions increase so greatly the pupils’ difficulties
in understanding what they read, that at the beginning of the
course it makes too great a task of that which should be a
source of interest and pleasure. To pass over these difficulties
and emphasize simply the story or description in the study of
poetry is to encourage the bad habit of careless, inaccurate
reading. If the pupil is taught to understand fully the prose
that he reads in the first year, his progress in reading poetry
in the following years will be much more rapid. These advantages
together with close correlation possible between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>study of prose and the theory and practice of composition
should determine the choice of reading for the first year.</p>

<p class='c003'>What has already been said in regard to the reading in
general (p. <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>) applies particularly to the first year work.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>VI<br /> <span class='large'>SECOND YEAR ENGLISH</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>1. Composition</h3>

<p class='c012'>In the second year the composition and the reading which
have been begun in the first year may be continued in about
the same proportion, that is, about one-half of the five periods
a week may be devoted to each. The work should be
largely a development and expansion of that of the first year.
In the study of the rhetorical principles the consideration of
sentence construction should be continued, and the principle
of emphasis and its application should be studied. The several
types of sentences, such as long, short, loose, periodic,
and balanced, and their uses should receive considerable attention,
and the importance of variety in sentence structure
may be emphasized. In the discussion of paragraph structure
more study may be given to the details of its construction
by developing the importance of the principles of emphasis,
as well as by considering again the principles of
unity and coherence. The methods of developing the paragraph
topic will naturally form a part of the work of paragraph
construction, particularly in the second semester, when
the principles of exposition are studied. The application of
the same principles of unity, emphasis, and coherence to the
whole theme, where it consists of a number of paragraphs,
may also be developed, for in the second year it is desirable
to have the students write longer themes, as well as the short
ones.</p>

<p class='c003'>The forms of discourse, narration and description, studied
in the first year, will also be developed and expanded during
the second year, and more emphasis can be placed upon the
several forms of description. From description the pupil can
be led by gradual steps to the study of exposition, and this
subject may be developed as fully as the maturity of the pupils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>will permit. It is also possible in some schools to undertake
the elementary forms of argumentation toward the end of the
second year, particularly if there is considerable interest and
activity in the school debating society, but it is not desirable
to undertake much of this work with immature pupils.</p>

<p class='c003'>The reading of the second year will also furnish material
for a study of words and figures of speech. In the analysis
and writing of description it is natural to note the effects of
different kinds of words, and to discriminate between the
general, colorless term and the specific, picture-making expression.
In description, likewise, the effectiveness of contrast,
or of a comparison in the form of a simile or metaphor
may be pointed out. In exposition emphasis must be given to
the importance of using the exact term to make clear the
idea, and to the dependence of clearness upon this accurate
choice and use of words. The use of comparisons, contrast,
and other figures of speech, may also be studied in relation to
exposition.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the second year, as in the first, the subjects for composition
should be drawn largely if not entirely, from the pupil’s
own experiences. In narrative and descriptive themes the
pupil, after his practice in the first year, will find little difficulty
in choosing the right kind of subjects. In exposition
he can be encouraged to write explanations of those subjects
with which he is thoroughly familiar. Simple manufacturing
processes, the operation of machinery or of mechanical devices
generally, methods of doing any kind of work, directions
for playing games, and many other similar subjects
that the pupil understands thoroughly, furnish excellent material
for simpler expository themes. If argumentation is undertaken,
the pupil may be led to discuss questions constantly
arising in connection with the life of the school and the community,
and thus he can obtain most of his material from
his own experiences.</p>

<p class='c003'>The plan of having one or two paragraph themes of from
150 to 200 words each week should be continued throughout
the second year. Every month or six weeks pupils should
write a longer theme of from 600 to 800 words, that is, a theme
of four or five paragraphs. Both the short and the long theme
should be promptly and carefully corrected by the teacher and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>revised or rewritten by the pupil. In the second year a careful
revision of the corrected themes by the pupils is usually
sufficient, but all themes that can be sufficiently improved to
make rewriting worth while, should be rewritten.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>2. Reading</h3>

<p class='c012'>The general purpose and the character of the reading in the
second year are the same as in the first. During the first part
of the year narrative and descriptive material should be read,
and during the second semester some of the simpler types of
essays may be used as a basis of a study of exposition. As has
already been indicated in connection with the composition, the
pupils’ attention should be directed to the use of words and
figures of speech in the masterpieces. The plot and its development,
and the form in which the story is told can be studied in
more detail than in the first year.</p>

<p class='c003'>Methods of describing persons and places and of delineating
character, taken up in connection with description, will
frequently be exemplified in the reading. Direction may be
given to the study of essays by considering them as examples
of exposition. All this analytical work ought to be carried on
with a view not only to developing inductively or illustrating
the principles of composition which it is desired to have the
pupils apply in their own writing, but also to having the pupils
understand the author’s purpose and the methods which he
uses to accomplish it; that is, to understand fully what they
are reading.</p>

<p class='c003'>The following may be taken as typical of the character of
the reading best adapted for the purposes outlined: Irving’s
“Sketch Book” and “Tales of the Alhambra”, Poe’s “Gold Bug”,
Thoreau’s “The Succession of Forest Trees”, Burroughs’ “Birds
and Bees” and “Sharp Eyes”, Macaulay’s “Lord Clive” and
“Life of Samuel Johnson”, Lincoln’s “Gettysburg Speech.” If
at the end of the first semester the pupils have learned to
read prose of average difficulty, it is often advantageous during
the second semester to study a play of Shakespeare’s, and
“Merchant of Venice” or “Julius Caesar” is well adapted for
this purpose. Narrative poetry such as Tennyson’s “Idylls of
the King”, Arnold’s “Sohrab and Rustum”, Coleridge’s “Ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Mariner”, or Scott’s “Lady of the Lake” may also be used
successfully during the second semester.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>VII<br /> <span class='large'>THIRD YEAR ENGLISH</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>1. Reading and History of Literature</h3>

<p class='c012'>The plan for the third year reading provides for a survey
of English and American literature, in which about three-fourths
of the time is to be devoted to English literature, and
one-fourth to American literature. In designating the reading
as a study of English and American literature, it is not intended
that the history of literature, as such, should occupy
any considerable portion of the time. It is not desirable to
devote more than one-tenth to one-fifth of the time, that is,
from one-half to one period a week, to text-book work in the
history of literature. The greater part of the time (about four
periods a week) should be spent in the reading of selections
from representative authors. In the study of the history of
literature, emphasis should be placed upon general movements
and tendencies in literature, and their relation to national conditions
and ideals. In each period one or two typical authors
should be selected whose works are to be studied in the class
room. Selections from writers contemporary with these authors
may be read by the pupils as library reading. In a
course of this kind it is much more important to have the
pupils read the literature than to have them read about literature.
It is also much more important to lead the pupils to perceive
the characteristics of the author in a selection read in or
out of the class room than to have these characteristics called
to their attention by the teacher or by reading criticism. In
connection with the course in the history of literature, a list of
books for outside reading should be prepared, and the pupils
should be encouraged to supplement the class room study by
reading other works of the authors studied in class. It seems
desirable to follow as far as possible the chronological order
in the reading done in and out of the class room so that the
pupil may be led to see the development of English and American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>literature and the relation of the work of one author to
that of those preceding and succeeding him.</p>

<p class='c003'>The detailed study of selections from the most important
English and American authors, is a large task for one year’s
work, but experience has shown that much can be accomplished
toward widening the pupils’ knowledge and appreciation
of literature by a course of this kind. After two years of
intensive study of the elements of expression, the average
pupil will be able to comprehend more readily what he reads,
and less time will have to be spent on the details. The selections
studied may also be regarded from a somewhat different
point of view from that taken during the first two years. The
piece of literature may be considered in relation to the author’s
personality and the age in which it was written, as
well as in comparison with other literature that has been read
by the pupils.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the history of English literature characteristic selections
from most of the following authors should be studied in
class: Chaucer, Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Pope, Addison,
Goldsmith, Gray, Burns, Scott, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats,
Shelley, Tennyson, Browning, Lamb, George Eliot, Dickens,
and Thackeray.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the survey of American literature the same general
method should be followed. As the pupils have generally read
considerable of the poetry of Longfellow, Whittier, Bryant,
and Holmes, as well as selections from the prose of Irving,
Hawthorne, and Thoreau, a brief review of these will be sufficient.
The class work should therefore consist largely of the
reading and study of works of authors not previously read in
class, such as the poems and short stories of Poe, essays of
Emerson, Lowell, and Holmes, and novels of Hawthorne and
Cooper.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>2. Composition</h3>

<p class='c012'>During the third year about one-fifth of the time, or one
period a week, should be devoted to English composition. One
short theme a week, and one long composition once in six
weeks will furnish the necessary practice in writing. While
the narrative and descriptive work of the first two years may
be continued, more emphasis should be placed upon expository
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>composition, in continuation of the study of exposition begun
in the second semester of the second year. Besides explaining
the various processes and simple mechanical devices with
which he is familiar, the pupil may be encouraged to express
his own opinions in regard to what he reads in literature. If
the conditions are favorable, the kind of elementary argumentation
suggested for the second year, may also be used in
theme work.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>VIII<br /> <span class='large'>FOURTH YEAR ENGLISH</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>1. Reading</h3>

<p class='c012'>In the fourth year about four-fifths of the time should be
allotted to reading and about one-fifth to composition. The
time assigned to the reading may most profitably be devoted to
an extensive study of a few typical examples of the most important
forms of literature. The novel, the drama, the lyric,
and the essay, may be taken as the types to be studied. The
maturity of the pupils in the fourth year will make possible
a detailed analysis of the essential elements of these forms,
which cannot be undertaken earlier in the course. By a careful
study of a few of the best examples of each form to be
found in English literature, the pupils not only come to know
and appreciate some of the best literature in our language
but are given some canons by which to judge what they read
independently after they leave school.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>2. The Novel</h3>

<p class='c012'>The novel is a convenient form with which to begin the
fourth year work. George Eliot’s “Silas Marner” is one of
the novels which lends itself admirably to intensive study.
The kind of novel, the theme, the author’s point of view, the
plot, the characters, the setting, and other important elements
are all to be carefully studied. In the detailed analysis of plot,
the introduction, the situation, the development of the plot, the
secondary plots, the interweaving of principal and subordinate
plots, the means of sustaining interest and suspense, the climax
of the action, the unraveling, the denouement and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>probability and plausibility of action, should receive consideration.
The study of character presented in the novel will include
the interaction of plot and character, the types of character,
the grouping of characters, the methods of delineation,
the truth to life, and similar points. It is also important to
consider the novel as the expression of the author’s personality,
of his attitude toward life, and of his interpretation, or
“criticism,” of life.</p>

<p class='c003'>Since time will permit of the detailed analysis, in class,
of but one novel, use for comparison may be made of other
novels which the pupils have read or are reading as a part of
their library work. Novels of such different types as Goldsmith’s
“Vicar of Wakefield,” Dickens’ “Tale of Two Cities,”
Scott’s “Ivanhoe,” and “Talisman,” Thackeray’s “Henry Esmond,”
Hawthorne’s “House of Seven Gables,” and George
Eliot’s “Romola,” will furnish ample supplementary material.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>3. The Drama</h3>

<p class='c012'>The consideration of plot, character, etc., in the novel will
prepare the way for a similar study of the drama. Shakespeare’s
“Macbeth” offers excellent opportunity for thoughtful
study. The important elements in the technique of dramatic
construction may be brought out inductively in the course of
the reading. The indirect and suggestive method of describing
character of the drama will give rise to much discussion, for
pupils will naturally differ in their estimates of the characters
as a result of different interpretations which they give to the
words and actions of the characters. To give a better conception
of the drama as it is to be acted, important scenes may be
presented in the class room by the pupils. The greater appreciation
of the drama and dramatic action which comes from
the preparation for an informal presentation of this kind,
makes it well worth undertaking.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some attention should also be given to the style and the
versification in so far as these are necessary for a better understanding
of the author’s methods.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>4. The Lyric</h3>

<p class='c012'>The study of lyric poetry, although often difficult alike to
teacher and pupils, should be undertaken during the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>semester of the fourth year. Much of the success will depend
upon the character of the lyrics selected for reading and study.
Palgrave’s “Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics,” containing
as it does much of the best English poetry of this type, is the
most convenient book to use. While interpretative reading
and the memorizing of these poems often lead to a real appreciation
of their music, and the emotions which they express,
a judicious analysis of metrical structure and poetic expression
will result in a better understanding of the essentials of
good poetry.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>5. The Essay</h3>

<p class='c012'>The expository essay, as the most difficult form of literature
for high school pupils, may well be left until the last part
of the fourth year. The analysis of the logical development of
the subject of the essay is of particular value at this stage of
the course. The outlining of the plan of the essay with its
divisions into sections, sub-sections, topics, subtopics, and details
is excellent practice. Macaulay’s essays, Burke’s “Speech
on Conciliation,” and Webster’s “First Bunker Hill Oration”
although, of course, the latter two are orations rather than
essays, afford material for this kind of study. Burke’s “Speech
on Conciliation,” although difficult for young pupils, is particularly
well adapted for analysis of logical structure, and may be
used to study methods of exposition and argumentation.</p>

<p class='c003'>The elements and qualities of prose style illustrated in
the essays should also be considered. Balance, parallelism,
antithesis, hyperbole, climax, terse and epigrammatic expression,
methods of transition and connection, and similar elements
of Macaulay’s style are sufficiently obvious to be readily
recognized by the high school pupil after his attention has
once been called to them. The rhetorical qualities of Burke’s
or Webster’s style are also evident enough to make possible
the study of them by high school pupils.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>6. Library Reading</h3>

<p class='c012'>The library reading for the fourth year can be arranged to
supplement the work done in class. Several standard novels,
two or three plays of Shakespeare, considerable lyric poetry,
and a number of essays may be assigned from time to time so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>that the library and class room reading will run parallel. Reference
by teacher and pupils to these pieces of literature by
way of comparison with those under consideration, will lead
to a close correlation of these two phases of the reading.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>7. Composition</h3>

<p class='c012'>The fourth year is in some respects the most important for
the work in composition. The ability to write good English
fluently, acquired by most of the pupils from several years of
constant practice; the maturity of the pupils; their larger
stock of knowledge and wider experience; and the possibility
of making practical application of their ability to write in preparing
orations and debates, reporting for local newspapers, or
editing the school publications; all tend to make composition a
more attractive and significant subject in the fourth year than
it seems to be at any other period of the course. The emphasis
will naturally be shifted from the mechanical details of expression
which necessarily occupy the greater portion of the
time in the earlier years of the course, to the larger and more
interesting problems of expression. The study of the principles
of exposition and argumentation, and of the development
of the theme, as they appear in the plan and outline of the
essay, take on new significance when their application to the
writing of a debate or a commencement oration is made clear.
The pupil discovers that the periodic sentence, parallel construction,
climax, and other rhetorical devices, are effective
means that he may use to accomplish his ends. For those
with literary inclinations the study of plot, characterization,
and poetic form and expression furnishes new inspiration for
their own work. The teacher who fails to take advantage of
this new interest in writing for practical purposes, by correlating
it closely with all the English work of the fourth year, is
losing the best opportunity of the course to teach the art of
effective expression.</p>

<p class='c003'>The amount of written work should be about the same as in
the third year; that is, a weekly theme of about 250 words, or
a fortnightly one of from 400 to 500 words; and a long theme
of from 800 to 1200 words at intervals of six weeks. The subjects
chosen for both long and short themes, in the course of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the year should give practice in all the forms of discourse,
narration, description, exposition, and argumentation, especially
in combinations as they are found in the literature that is
read in and out of the class room. The writing of a short story
or of a chapter of a novel proves an interesting form of composition
when fiction is being studied. The consideration of
problems of character in the novels and dramas read and
studied, permits pupils to express their opinions in essay form,
while debates on questions growing out of class room discussions
will give practice in argumentation. The preparation of
commencement essays and orations, as has already been suggested,
can readily be made a part of theme writing during the
second semester.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>8. Writing of Verse</h3>

<p class='c012'>The writing of verse has frequently been tried in the fourth
year, and has generally proved an interesting and valuable
exercise. The reading of poetry in the third and fourth years
makes necessary some study of metre and verse forms, and
with the information thus obtained as a basis, many pupils,
it has been found, can write creditable verse. Exercises beginning
with blank verse, octosyllabic and heroic couplets, and
continuing with the quatrain, the triolet, the rondeau, the
Spenserian stanza, and possibly the sonnet, can be given from
time to time in place of weekly themes and will usually arouse
considerable interest. Efforts to write verse, whether entirely
successful or not, give the pupils a keener feeling for rhyme
and rhythm, a better understanding of metrical forms, and
of the nature of poetical composition; and to that extent
should heighten their appreciation of poetry.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>XI<br /> <span class='large'>OUTLINE FOR THE STUDY OF COMPOSITION AND STYLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The following is a fairly complete outline of the essential
elements of rhetorical theory as applied in composition work
and in a study of structure and style. As such, it is designed
primarily for the teacher who desires to review any part of the
subject in preparation for teaching composition. Many portions
may be used in the class room in a simplified form, to
supplement or summarize parts of the text-books in rhetoric
and composition. The books to which references are given are
in general the most convenient and comprehensive manuals
for the particular parts of the subject with which each deals.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
